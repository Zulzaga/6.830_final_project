\section{Conclusion}
In consistent with findings already existing in the original paper, we found the cracking approach to outperform both sort bases strategy and traditional index under changing workload. As more and more queries arrive, the cost of physically reorganizing the data is spread over all the queries. In our workload environment, we found each of the different cracker index implementations to have certain pros and cons over each other, meanwhile all equally performing much faster to the baseline. 


Overall, by using the cracker index the database automatically adapts to any workload and creates a re-organization that serve subsequent queries faster and faster. We believe that the database cracking idea has a great potential to revolutionize the traditional approach.
